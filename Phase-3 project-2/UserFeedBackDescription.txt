Spring Boot User Feedback 

Introduction:
In the realm of developing a comprehensive ecommerce web application,
one crucial aspect is to gather user feedback efficiently. To address this requirement, 
we aim to create a Spring Boot project with a RESTful API endpoint capable of capturing user feedback.

Project Components:

Spring Boot Framework:

Purpose: To simplify the development of the application and to provide a robust, production-ready environment.
Role: Facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs and integrates seamlessly with other Spring components.
Hibernate:

Purpose: As an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, Hibernate will be employed to handle database interactions.
Role: Translates Java objects to database tables and vice versa, offering an abstraction layer for database operations.
Eclipse IDE:

Purpose: Chosen as the Integrated Development Environment for its user-friendly interface and extensive support for Java development.
Role: Enables efficient coding, debugging, and project management.
Apache Tomcat:

Purpose: As a widely used web server, Apache Tomcat will be utilized to deploy and run the Spring Boot application.
Role: Hosts the application, making it accessible over the web.

Database Table:

Name: user_feedback
Columns:
id (Primary Key, Auto-increment): Unique identifier for each feedback entry.
user_id (String): Stores the user identifier.
feedback_text (Text): Holds the feedback content.
timestamp (Timestamp): Records the time when the feedback was received.

Workflow:

Data Submission:

Third-party applications and websites will send feedback data to the /api/feedback endpoint using HTTP POST requests.
Spring Boot Processing:

The Spring Boot application will capture the incoming feedback data and validate the parameters.
Database Interaction:

Hibernate will be responsible for persisting the validated feedback data into the user_feedback table.


Conclusion:

This Spring Boot project, orchestrated with Hibernate, serves as a pivotal component in 
the ecommerce web application's ecosystem. It seamlessly captures and stores user feedback,
providing a valuable resource for enhancing user experience and refining the overall application
